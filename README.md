# AF / Jobtech case

This project is a group assignment where we created a custom version of "Platsbanken" using open data from Arbetsförmedlingen.  
The goal was to explore real-world job advertisement data and present it in a user-friendly application while practicing React concepts, data fetching, and visualization.
Using Arbetsförmedlingens design system but with different color.
